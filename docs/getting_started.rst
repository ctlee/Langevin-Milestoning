Dependencies
============

This package requires ``numpy`` and ``scipy``. You'll also need a working C
compiler and build environment, to compile various C-level extensions.

Easy Way (Recommended)
----------------------

The easiest way to get all of the dependencies is to install one of the 
pre-packaged scientific python distributes like `Enthought's Canopy 
<https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_ or `Continuum's Anaconda 
<https://store.continuum.io/>`_. These distributions already contain all of 
the dependences, and are distributed via 1-click installers.
